Code Louisville JS project - What's for Dinner

What's For Dinner is a web based application that allows you to enter your favoite recipes and the supplies you have on hand via a form that feeds a database.  Then you can ask "What's for Dinner" and the program will return the recipes in the order of what you should make to utilize things you already have at home.
